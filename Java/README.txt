README for Sample Servlets

Included is the .WAR file and Directory including the source, classes, xml servlet mapping (web.xml), and webpages (index.html and form.html)

To deploy either copy the directory into your tomcat/wtpwebapps/ directory or use the Tomcat App Manager to upload, extract, and deploy the .WAR file.

The index file that lists the two servlets can be reached at: localhost:8080/SampleServlets

** That is if you have the port set to the default of 8080 **

The source files can be found in Java/SampleServlets/WEB-INF/classes/edu/tcnj/csc/cloud

Thank you! Feel free to contribute & modify!
